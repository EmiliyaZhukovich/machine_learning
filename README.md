# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects completed during my studies at the **Plekhanov Russian University of Economics**. These projects cover a range of topics, including classification, regression, clustering and so on. Each project demonstrates the application of different machine learning algorithms and techniques, as well as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Sklearn** (for machine learning models and preprocessing)
  - **Pandas** and **NumPy** (for data manipulation and analysis)
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for data visualization)
